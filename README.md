# Tutorials on various topics of physics and math

## Content

-  `Finite_topologies.ipynb`: shows all possible topologies for a finite set by checking every possible combination of subsets. Also studies separation axioms $T_0$, $T_1$, $T_2$, $T_3$, and $T_4$ for generated topological spaces.
-  `Tranverse_field_Ising_and_Jordan-Wigner_transform.ipynb`: studying how the Jordan-Wigner transform works for describing phase transition in the 1D transverse-field Ising model.
- `qutils.py`: contains some useful functions for operating with quantum stuff.
